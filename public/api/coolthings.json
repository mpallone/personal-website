Once this was completed I was selected out of ~10 test engineers to be the sole system test engineer for the command and data handling software. Tests in this role included flight software stress tests and an in-orbit bug fix test.</p><p>My role expanded beyond testing to include supporting satellite-level environmental testing and ultimately launch support, where I sat in the DSCOVR launch control room with the flight software lead to debug in-flight issues and thoroughly test in-flight software bug fixes.</p><p>Before launch, my colleagues nominated me for the GSFC \"Mission Impossible\" peer award, where the principal attitude and orbital control flight software engineer wrote: \"He is a very high performer who is well liked, dedicated, innovative, learns quickly, and has shown a willingness to put in extra time and effort to see tough tasks through.\" </p>"

I wrote buffer overflow exploits using ROP gadgets, XSS and CSRF exploits, and a browser worm inspired by the infamous <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130329061059/http://namb.la:80/popular/tech.html\">Samy worm.</a> I also broke a simple web server process into separate containers with a restricted RPC interface to improve isolation, implemented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concolic_testing\">concolic execution</a> functionality, and implemented a remote file system that had integrity guarantees even when an adversary controls the file server.
