I wrote buffer overflow exploits using ROP gadgets, XSS and CSRF exploits, and a browser worm inspired by the infamous <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130329061059/http://namb.la:80/popular/tech.html\">Samy worm.</a> I also broke a simple web server process into separate containers with a restricted RPC interface to improve isolation, implemented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concolic_testing\">concolic execution</a> functionality, and implemented a remote file system that had integrity guarantees even when an adversary controls the file server. (Note: course instructors have requested that project solutions be kept off github, so these repositories are only available upon request.)</p>"
